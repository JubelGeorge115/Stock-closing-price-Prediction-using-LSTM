# Stock-closing-price-Prediction-using-LSTM
<br>
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture used in deep learning. It is particularly effective for time series prediction because it can learn from previous data points to make future predictions. In this project, LSTM is utilized to predict the closing price of stocks.

Project Description:
<br>
The project aims to predict the closing prices of stocks using LSTM.

Process
<br>
Data Collection:
<br>

Collect historical stock price data, which includes the open, high, low, close prices, and volume.
<br>
Data Preprocessing:
<br>
Normalize the data to scale the features to a range that is suitable for training the LSTM.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Create sequences of data for the LSTM to learn from, typically using a sliding window approach.
<br>
Model Building:
<br>

Define an LSTM model using a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or Keras.
Specify the number of LSTM units, layers, and other hyperparameters.
<br>
Training:
<br>

Train the LSTM model on the training data.
Monitor the model's performance using loss metrics.
<br>
Prediction:
<br>

Use the trained model to predict the closing prices on the test data.
Compare the predicted values with the actual closing prices to evaluate the model's performance.
<br>

Conclusion
<br>

Using LSTM for stock price prediction can capture the temporal dependencies in the data, making it a powerful tool for such tasks. The project involves data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation to predict future stock closing prices. By leveraging the capabilities of LSTM, this approach can provide more accurate and reliable predictions.
